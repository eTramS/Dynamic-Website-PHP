                        <p class="lead">Back 4 Blood is honestly a great game as long as you can get over the fact it's not Left 4 Dead 3. If you like co-op zombie smashing, there's honestly not much to dislike. Graphics are gorgeous, gameplay is really smooth, and the characters are cool. The deck building system gets trolled a lot, but once you get the hang of it it's not bad and it can add a bit of variety to gameplay. It gives you the ability to try different builds, for example run/gun, healer, melee, support - you can save multiple decks if you like. If you find you don't like the card system, it's easy to make a single standard deck that fits your play style and roll with it. Back 4 Blood is definitely worth trying if you're a fan of fast paced zombie slaying with friends.</p>

                        <p class="lead">So I am over 60 years old and fairly new to gaming in general. Jumping from World of Warships (fairly new at that also) to this gives you an idea. Before this it had been many years since playing ANY games. So, I am floored by this game. To me its amazing. Now I set the combat at an easy level and I bumble around in here and am in no hurry. I explore around sometimes doing nothing but looking around. I have gone through a fair amount of the story line - again - its all amazing to me. In short I love it. I now am branching to more games, as I find I enjoy playing more then one game at a time. I love the characters of this game, the visuals of it, and have no complaints. Occasionally I run across a very minor glitch of getting stuck or something, but this does not bother me. I do not expect perfection. But I want to emphasize this is very rare. Well done to the developers of this game.</p>

                        <p class="lead">The game has mixed reviews but its honestly pretty fun.
i just played the game strait for 5 hours and just had more and more fun, this game is also on console and other platforms so the player-base is higher than what steam shows.
the only bug i have encountered is that when you die with the key, the map and HUD shows 3 keys around the map even when someone picks it up.</p>
